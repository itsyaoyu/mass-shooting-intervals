# mass_shooting_intervals

Project Summary
------
This project replicates the research by Lin et al. (2018)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6193640/] on mass shooting intervals and looks at how the intervals have continued to changed since the publication. The authors were  looking at the time trend and associated risk factors for mass shootings, but their results regarding the time intervals will be the main focus in this project. Regarding intervals between mass shootings, the authors found that the interval has been decreasing in the past three decades with the rate of shootings increasing. Specifically, I will be using the regressions created in the paper to compare the expected intervals of shootings in the past two years with the actual intervals. Visualizing the intervals between shootings is crucial information that could help identify if recent preventative measures have been effective at decreasing the number of mass shootings. It also provides insight for what still needs to be done and if further preventative measures need to be implemented.
